This is the Simple-Placeholder jQuery Plugin developed by Joey Yore.

This plugin is designed to give a placeholder to text edit boxes.  
This placeholder will change colors when the user focuses/unfocuses 
the placeholder.  If the user inputs any character, then the placeholder
disappears and the key press registers as normal.  If the user leaves the
edit box blank, then the placeholder is restored.  The user inputted text
will not change colors.
